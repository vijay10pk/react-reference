- We have a central store to store and manage all the state.
- Component just subscribe to these store and they cannot directly manipulate the state.
- We use reducer to mutate the state in the store.
- Reducer functions are functions that takes in a input and gives a new output.
- Actions - Component dispatch(trigger) action(operation) which the action will forward it to the reducer function and which in turn will update the data in store and the
    subscribed components are then notified and updated with the new state data.
